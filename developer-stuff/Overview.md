# âœ¨ AI Video Generator: Enhanced Iterative Development Plan âœ¨

This enhanced overview provides a clear, visually engaging roadmap for building your AI video generator [Viducator], emphasizing the seamless flow between development phases and the critical human checkpoints at each stage.

This plan breaks down app development into manageable phases, with two crucial human checkpoints per phase. This ensures quality and allows for informed decisions before moving forward!

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Frontend Core & Mocked Workflow ðŸš€

**Goal:** Establish the complete user interface flow with simulated AI responses. This is where your app looks and feels complete, even before the real AI is hooked up!

### Human Checkpoint 1.1: Barebones Frontend Setup

```
+---------------------------+
|      Vue.js App           |
|      (Hello World!)       |
|      (Deployed on         |
|       Vercel)             |
+---------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Confirm foundational frontend and deployment infrastructure.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- Vue.js application successfully builds and loads in a web browser.
- Application is deployed and accessible via its Vercel-generated URL.
- A basic "Hello World" (or equivalent) message is displayed without errors.

### Human Checkpoint 1.2: Full Mocked Workflow Completion

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|        UI Screens with Mock Data                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
|  Scenario Input -> Script Review (Mock Script)      |
|     -> Image Review (Placeholder Images)            |
|     -> Voice Review (Playable Mock Audio)           |
|     -> Animation Review (Mock Video Clips)          |
|     -> Lip-Sync Review (Mock Refined Clips)         |
|     -> Final Render (Mock Final Video)              |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Validate the entire user journey and all UI components with mock data.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- User can input scenario details and click "Generate Video Idea."
- The UI displays simulated loading states and transitions through all 6 video generation steps.
- Mock data (script text, placeholder images, playable mock audio/video) is displayed correctly at each review step.
- "Approve," "Edit & Regenerate," and "Retry" buttons at each stage correctly simulate state transitions and regeneration of mock data.
- The "Final Render" step displays a mock completed video and download/restart options.

## ðŸ’¾ Phase 2: Database & Storage Integration ðŸ’¾

Once your frontend is fully functional and the mocked workflow is seamless, it's time to persist that magic to a database. This phase connects your app to Supabase for reliable data storage.

### Human Checkpoint 2.1: Supabase Infrastructure Setup

```
+-------------------------------------+
|      Supabase Dashboard             |
|-------------------------------------|
|  âœ” video_jobs table exists          |
|  âœ” video-assets bucket exists       |
|  âœ” final-videos bucket exists       |
|  âœ” Manual CRUD operations work      |
|  âœ” Test file uploads/downloads ok   |
+-------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Confirm Supabase database and storage are correctly provisioned and accessible.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- video_jobs PostgreSQL table exists in your Supabase dashboard.
- Manual CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on video_jobs table work via Supabase SQL editor.
- Storage buckets (video-assets, final-videos) are created and accessible.
- Manual upload/download of a test file to Supabase Storage is successful.

### Human Checkpoint 2.2: Frontend-to-Supabase Integration Completion

```
+-------------------------------------+
|      App UI connected to Supabase   |
|-------------------------------------|
|  (User progresses through workflow) |
|  âœ” Job record created in Supabase DB|
|  âœ” Status & outputs update in DB    |
|  âœ” Browser refresh retains job state|
|  âœ” All UI actions reflect DB changes|
+-------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Validate that the frontend can correctly read from and write to Supabase, persisting the workflow state.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- Initiating a new video job creates a record in the Supabase video_jobs table.
- Progressing through each mocked step updates the status and current_outputs fields in the database record.
- Refreshing the browser (or navigating away and back) allows the application to resume the job from the correct step, loading data directly from Supabase.

## ðŸ¤– Phase 3: Backend Workers & Real API Integration ðŸ¤–

With your app's state now durable in Supabase, the next big leap is connecting to the real AI power in the backend! This phase deploys worker services on Railway to integrate with external AI APIs.

### Human Checkpoint 3.1: Backend Compute & Queue Infrastructure

```
+-------------------------------------+
|      Railway Deployment             |
|-------------------------------------|
|  âœ” Railway project created          |
|  âœ” Redis service deployed           |
|  âœ” Worker service deployed          |
|  âœ” Worker connects to Redis/Supabase|
|  âœ” Test message processed by worker |
+-------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Confirm Railway is set up to host workers and Redis, forming the backbone of asynchronous processing.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- Railway project is created with Redis and a worker service deployed.
- The worker service connects successfully to Redis and Supabase (check Railway logs).
- A minimal test message pushed to Redis is consumed and processed by the worker (e.g., logged to console).

### Human Checkpoint 3.2: Real API Integration Completion

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|        End-to-End Real AI Generation                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
|  âœ” Frontend triggers real API calls (check logs)    |
|  âœ” Script (Gemini) is REAL text                     |
|  âœ” Images (Leonardo.AI) are REAL & uploaded to S3   |
|  âœ” Voices (Eleven Labs) are REAL & uploaded to S3   |
|  âœ” Base Animation (HeyGen) is REAL & uploaded to S3 |
|  âœ” Lip-Sync (Sync Labs) is REAL & uploaded to S3    |
|  âœ” Final Video (MoviePy/FFmpeg) is REAL & plays!    |
|  âœ” Final video uploaded to S3                       |
|  âœ” Overall quality of assets is acceptable          |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Validate the entire end-to-end automated process with real AI outputs.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- Submitting a scenario from the frontend triggers real API calls to Google Gemini, Leonardo.AI, Eleven Labs, HeyGen, and Sync Labs (check Railway logs and API provider dashboards).
- Generated script, images, audio, base animations, and lip-synced clips are real (not placeholders) and are uploaded to Supabase Storage.
- The frontend accurately displays these real assets at each review stage.
- The final video is a correctly assembled, real MP4 file (not a placeholder) uploaded to Supabase Storage.
- The overall quality of the generated assets is acceptable for each AI service.

## âœ… Phase 4: Refinement & Production Readiness âœ…

After witnessing your AI pipeline come alive with real data, it's time to fortify your app for real-world usage. This phase focuses on robustness and user experience.

### Human Checkpoint 4.1: Error Handling Validation

```
+-------------------------------------+
|      Error Recovery Testing         |
|-------------------------------------|
|  âœ” API call failures trigger FAILED |
|    status updates in DB             |
|  âœ” Error messages displayed in UI   |
|  âœ” "Retry" button attempts re-run   |
|  âœ” System recovers after error fixed|
+-------------------------------------+
```

**Purpose:** Confirm the system's ability to gracefully handle errors and allow user recovery.

**App Capabilities to Test:**
- When an API call fails (e.g., due to a bad prompt or temporary network issue), the job status in the UI updates to a FAILED state (e.g., FAILED_IMAGE_GEN).
- An informative error message is displayed to the user.
- The user can click a "Retry" button, which attempts to re-run the failed step, and it proceeds successfully if the underlying issue is resolved.

### Human Checkpoint 4.2: Production Readiness & UX Finalization

```
+-------------------------------------+
|      Final Polish & Readiness       |
|-------------------------------------|
|  âœ” User authentication works        |
|  âœ” Job history displayed for user   |
