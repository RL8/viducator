**Status**: ✅ Production Ready | 🔨 Build Tested | 📁 Repository Organized

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

- ✅ Vue.js app builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All components are production-ready  
- ✅ Supabase integration implemented
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Git repository with clean commit history
- ✅ Project structure organized for deployment

## 🌐 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new repository
   - Repository name: `viducator`
   - Description: "AI-powered video generation platform"
   - Public repository (recommended)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Connect local repository to GitHub:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/viducator.git
git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** and sign in with GitHub
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Import your `viducator` repository**
4. **Configure project settings:**
   - Framework: Vue.js (auto-detected)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
   - Node.js Version: 18.x or latest LTS

### Step 3: Environment Variables

In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, add:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Important**: These must match your actual Supabase project credentials.

### Step 4: Deploy & Test

1. **Click "Deploy"** in Vercel
2. **Wait for build to complete** (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. **Get your live URL**: `https://viducator-abc123.vercel.app`
4. **Test the deployment**: All features should work

## 🗄️ Supabase Production Configuration

### Update CORS Settings
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings:
```
Site URL: https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
Additional redirect URLs: https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/**
```

### Verify Database Schema
Ensure your Supabase project has:
- ✅ `video_jobs` table created
